#This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:
#
#seven(times(five())) # must return 35
#four(plus(nine())) # must return 13
#eight(minus(three())) # must return 5
#six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3
#Requirements:
#
#There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
#There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby and Python)
#Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
#The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
#Divison should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
#eight(divided_by(three()))


numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
#operators = [plus, minus, times, divided_By]
for i in numbers:
    def i(operator):
        return number
    
zero(5)

        
        #for i in range(len(numbers)):
            
        #for operator in operators:
         #   def operator(number):
